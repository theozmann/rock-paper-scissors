# rock-paper-scissors

Welcome to my rock paper scissors project! 

This is a small project I will be using to begin my JavaScript learning journey!
I am currently using The Odin Project to help me learn and am building this as my
first JavaScript program through The Odin Project.

With this project a learned:

- How to select elements of the DOM with JavaScript
- How to create new elements in the DOM with JavaScript and give it a class for CSS styling
- How to use arrow functions with Event Listeners when a button is clicked
- How to make a random selection using Math.random
- How to add audio and have it play when certain criteria are met
